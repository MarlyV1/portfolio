# Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio was created in order to demonstrate the CSS and HTML skills that I've learned. It also allows potential employers to see the varying projects that I will get to complete. The first project shows how I was able to refractor existing code for a website while maintaining its existing function. 

## Usage


By clicking on the navigation bar, a user of the website will be able to go to the three different sections of the page. They will also be able to open the projects in a new tab by selecting one of the projects located in the works section. Furthermore, my GitHub repository can be accessed by clicking the link within the contact me section. In additon to this the responsiveness of the website can be witnessed by going into the Chrome Developer Tools and changing the size of the page.
